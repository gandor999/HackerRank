# HackerRank
This is a compilation of all my solutions for my weekly questions in HackerRank

Camel Case 4 in particular is a question that I'm quite relieved to have solved. It took me a while to remove the "\r" and "\n" since I wasn't acustomed to 
removing these when an input is read on the console. HackerRank should really specify these things but then again it might have just been their way of
teaching people such as myself the essence of looking over the console and code... Though it was still frustrating...
